                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]</p>
            <h3>Chocolate History</h3>
            <p>Chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate's preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.</p>
            <p>An early Classic-period (460â€“480 AD) Maya tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD</p>
            <h3>TYPES</h3>

            <h7>Dark</h7>
            <p>Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture.</p>
            <h7>Milk</h7>
